  "description": "No, this isn’t the banny based on a certain male impotence drug. And no, I don’t blame you for going there. This banny has bigger worries than a limp dick, and notice that six pack? Yeah, he’s definitely on something. Dr. Osterman is a monumental force that has never been fully unleashed on this world. He has tipped the scales in major events across history, and he does so still in the Bannyverse. Only the oldest, most senior bannies can communicate with him, and even then quite sparingly. What will happen when he breaks free from his mysterious constraints? An unfettered Dr. Osterman is a recipe for Armageddon, or so the other God-tier bannies will tell you.",
