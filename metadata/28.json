  "description": "From bar tending to ass kicking, Desmond Miles does it all. Like so many bananas that strike out from home to start a new life, Desmond never thought heâ€™d find a future in being an elite assassin. After all, who wants to carry on a family tradition when the world has so much to offer? Truly, the grass is always greener. But what Desmond never expected was that proverbial truth: people tend to follow in the footsteps of their parents. Little did he know that he was destined to be amongst the greatest bannies, and in so doing become their greatest sacrifice.",
