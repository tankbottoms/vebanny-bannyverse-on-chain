  "description": "If he’s not busy smuggling goods and stacking paper like a boss, there are few things John Rowe likes to do more in his spare time than to grab a bit of bait and head out onto the open water. His tranquil nature belies a serious business acumen, and his bait and rod could slay even the most feisty fish in the sea. Whether he’s out on the lake or in the throes of a business deal going south, he always play his cards close to his chest. Forsooth, nary a banana nor a monster of the sea can outsmart this shrewd old banana.",
