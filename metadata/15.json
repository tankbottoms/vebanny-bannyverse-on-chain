  "description": "Horned and horny, Ivar the Viking is a Banana you don’t want to mess with. Clad in all the trappings of a barbarian invader and with double the gusto, Ivar loves nothing more than a good pillage. This bonerific Banny is not without affliction, however: suffering from brittle bones that are prone to microfracturing, Ivar is a glass canon if there ever was one. His penchant for good scraps and plundering aside, he loves a good meal and a good joke. Some may ask if he feels bad for all the carnage he brings with him, and he probably does deep down— thank goodness for repression.",
