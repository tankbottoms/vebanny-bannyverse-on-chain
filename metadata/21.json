  "description": "If class and style is what you want, look no further than this very gentlemanly banana. Bannible Lector is someone you can count on for a good classical music recommendation or tips on how to whip up a nice Chateaubriand. His culinary exploits are quite daring and he’s never been afraid to take a risk, whether in or out of the kitchen. With a laser-focused mind that can read you like an open book, he finds all the restraints he’s packaged up in just a tad off-putting. Come help him take off his straitjacket and muzzle— he’ll reward you with a nice home-cooked dish!",
