  "description": "At times sweet, at times sour, Tinkerbanny is a mercurial banana to be sure. She has a penchant for fixing and augmenting all things physical— a tinkerer in the truest sense of the word— and she’s been known to run a shop that other bannies frequent. If you need to modulate your gun to full auto, or get some chips out of your samurai sword, she’s your banana. She’s also a bit moody, to put it lightly, so you better catch her on a good day. Nothing worse than a weapons shop hosted by an angry banny, after all. She definitely likes to be cherished and treated with care. Hopefully the other bannies can remember that.",
