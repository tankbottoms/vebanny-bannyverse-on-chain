  "description": "Much conjecture exists around this banny. He’s definitely an oddball who casts a wide shadow. He walks with a slight limp, perhaps the result of a clubbed foot. He may have some neurodegenerative disorders. He’s short and awkward. But nothing surprising for a banny who’s mother is his father’s sister. I mean you’re really scraping the bottom of the genetic barrel on that one. But by the same token, some believe this is all just a subterfuge for a crafty leader. Some would say Pharaoh King Banatut is a shrewd politician. Some would say that mountains were moved for him.",
