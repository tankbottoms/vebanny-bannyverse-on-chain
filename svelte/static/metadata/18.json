  "description": "Smalls isn’t a banana that strikes you as remarkable at first glance, but that’s only because it takes him a while to come into his own. He’s a moderately tempered, mellow-headed banana that experienced many rites of passage to get where he is. He may not be the first banana you think of when you need a pinch hitter at the bottom of the ninth, but you can definitely count on him being there and having your back. He’s a good banana, at a time when that old childhood innocent fun-loving life is the exception, not the rule. Wholesome, whether in a bowl of cereal or on top of a 1950’s style banana split, Smalls brings you good times and comfort.",
