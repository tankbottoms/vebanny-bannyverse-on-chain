  "description": "Doesn’t get more laid back than Buddha Banny. He threw it all away— opulence, wealth, fame— in order to find inner peace under a tree. He did so at a young age and rejected his material possessions well into adulthood. He ate pork, sometimes quite greedily. And he inspired a movement that goes on to this day in the Bannyverse. Many bannies seek him out, but he is of few words. They say he won’t even open up to you unless you bring him a nice pork dish. Who knew self-actualization was so transactional.",
