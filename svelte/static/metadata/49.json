  "description": "Every good banana has a wild side, and Dr. Quinzel is the embodiment of that. A former psychiatrist who did a lot of good helping the most tortured of bananas, she broke out into the Bannyverse with an unmatched eagerness for mayhem. Perhaps she was screwed too tight for most of her life, or maybe, like the strongest diamond shatters in an explosion of magnificent shards, Harleen is unleashed in the Bannyverse in all her mayhem. She’s chasing a long-lost lover— a former patient— and she’s sure she’ll find him. Unless, of course, a careful reader finds him first.",
